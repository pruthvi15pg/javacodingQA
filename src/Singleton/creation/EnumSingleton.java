    /*
   Problem:
Traditional Singleton implementations (synchronized, double-checked locking, Bill Pugh) solve thread safety and lazy loading, but they still need careful coding.
They can be broken by:
    Serialization (creates a new instance unless handled properly).
    Reflection (can call private constructors).
We need a singleton thatâ€™s immune to these issues.

Solution â†’ Enum Singleton
In Java, Enums are inherently thread-safe and provide serialization safety for free.
The JVM guarantees that any Enum value is instantiated only once

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s the Best

âœ” Thread-safe â†’ Handled by JVM.
âœ” Serialization-safe â†’ Enum guarantees a single instance.
âœ” Reflection-safe â†’ Reflection cannot instantiate enums.
âœ” Simplest code â†’ Just INSTANCE.
